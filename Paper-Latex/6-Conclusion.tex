We described the system for hyperpartisan detection which we developed for SemEval 2019 - Task 4.  The essence of our system was SVC with GridSearch built on a variety of handcrafted features. The task itself was a complex NLP problem, as hyperpartisanism detection in text often presents a problem even for an experienced human reader. Our main mission was to extract a few quality features that would help us tackle this convoluted problem. Future work includes experiments with different classifiers and possibly neural networks. Furthermore, our mission in feature extraction will continue and we hope to find some more linguistic features that would help us to improve and upgrade our model.
