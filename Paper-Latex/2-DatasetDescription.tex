\section{Dataset description}
\label{sec:task}

The dataset, which was provided by task organizers, was divided into two separate clusters. The first and larger cluster consisted of one million news articles labelled solely by the political affiliation of the \textit{publisher}. The second and much smaller cluster consisted of one thousand news articles labelled by people who read and evaluated them. 

There was a substantial difference in labelling between these two datasets, so the quality and accuracy of the smaller dataset greatly overshadowed the abundance of articles in the larger dataset.
Furthermore, the articles mostly came from larger American news publishers such as: FOX News, CNN, Vox and similar. This predominance of big American news networks and the substantial difference in quality largely impacted our feature designing and ultimately our model selection.

The task itself was not divided into subtasks, but the submission on these two different datasets was regarded as a different subtask. The final test set, on which the main leaderboard is made, consisted solely of the articles from the smaller and more accurate dataset.
