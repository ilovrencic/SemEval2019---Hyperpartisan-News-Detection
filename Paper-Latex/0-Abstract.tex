  In this paper we demonstrate the system built to solve the SemEval-2019 task 4: Hyperpartisan News Detection
\citep{kiesel:2019}, the task of automatically determining 
whether an article is heavily biased towards one side of the political spectrum. 
Our system takes in an article in its raw, textual form, analyzes it and predicts with moderate accuracy whether the article is hyperpartisan.
The learning model used was primarily trained on a manually pre-labeled dataset containing news articles.
The system relies on the previously constructed SVM model, available in the Python Scikit-Learn library.
We ranked 6th in the competition of 42 teams with the accuracy of 79.1\% (the winning team had 82.2\%).
