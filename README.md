# SemEval2019-Hyperpartisan-News-Detection

**SemEval** (**Sem**antic **Eval**uation) is ongoing series of evaluations of computational semantic analysis systems.
On SemEval2019 my team ( Juraj Vladika, Niko Palic and Dominik Cubelic (@dcubelic)) and I have participated in Task 4 - Hyperpartisan news detection. In this git repo, I will submit our final System Description paper and our final submitted model.
